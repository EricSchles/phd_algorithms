# Algorithms

The goal of this repo is to serve as a memorialization of the algorithms class I took in fall 2021.

## How this will work

I'm going to use the supporting material from MIT and stanford to review all the relevant course material.  As well as going through the course at the normal pace.  My plan is to do 1.5 hours of work on this class per day during the week.  And 3 hours each weekend day, starting august 26th, through the end of the class.

I will upload all of my notes, code, and attempts at the various homework assignments.  Correct solutions will be attempted, but I make no claim that my solutions are in fact correct, as I am still learning the material.

Alright I have the basic sketch of the proof for explainers -
